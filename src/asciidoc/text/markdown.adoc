== Markdown Syntax

Markdown is a way to style text on the web.
You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphaabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

=== Headers

[source, shell]
----
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
----

=== Emphasis

[source, shell]
----
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

*You **can** combine them*
----

=== Lists

.Unordered
[source, shell]
----
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
----

.Ordered
[source, shell]
----
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b
----

=== Images

[source, shell]
----
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)

Format: ![Alt Text](url)
----

=== Links

[source, shell]
----
http://github.com - automatic!

[Github](http://github.com)
----

=== Blockquotes

[source, shell]
----
As Kanye West Said

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
----

=== Backslash Escapes

[source, shell]
----
\*literal asterisks\*
----

Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:

|===
| `\` backslash        | `()` parentheses
| ` backtick           | `#` hash mark
| `*` asterisk         | `+` plus sign
| `_` underscore       | `-` minus sign (hyphen)
| `{}` curly braces    | `.` dot
| `[]` square brackets | `!` exclamation mark
|===

== GitHub Flavored Markdown

GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

=== Username @MENTIONS

Typing an `@` symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment.
This is called an _"@mention"_, because you're mentioning the individual.
You can also @mention teams within an organization.

=== Issue References

Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically converted into a link.

[source, shell]
----
#1
defunkt#1
defunkt/github-flavored-markdown#1
----

=== Task Lists

[source, shell]
----
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](),
**formatting**, and <del>tags</del>
supported
- [x] list syntax required (any
unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
----

=== Fenced Code Blocks

Markdown coverts text with four leading spaces into a code block; with GFM you can wrap your code with ``` to create a code block without the leading spaces.
Add an optional language identifier and your code with get syntax highlighting.

[source, shell]
----
```javascript
function test() {
  console.log("look ma `, no spaces");
}
```
----

=== Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

[source, shell]
----
First Header     | Second Header
-----------------|--------------
Content cell 1   | Content cell 2
Content column 1 | Content column 2
----
